The International Fossil Coral and Reef Society was founded in the early 1970's under the name International Association for the Study of Fossil Cnidaria and Sponges. It promotes research on fossil corals, sponges, and reefs in the broadest sense. The main event of the society's activities is an international symposium held every four years. The last symposium was in ChÄ™ciny, Poland in Sept. 2023. The next will be hosted in Toulouse, France in 2027. We also host online annual early career research symposiums with the next organised by our colleagues in Chengdu & Nanjing, China (Nov. 2024).
