The International Fossil Coral and Reef Society (IFCRS) invites all participants of the 14^th^ Symposium of the IFCRS (Poland, 10-16^th^ September 2023) to publish their conference presentations as contributions to the international quarterly open access journal ***Acta Paleontologica Polonica*** IF = 2.108 [https://www.app.pan.pl/home.html](https://www.app.pan.pl/home.html).   

Following the conference thematic sessions we envisage that the contributions will cover the following topics: (1) Corals and climate change, (2) Coral biomineralization and skeletal proxies; (3) Challenges of coral phylogeny and taxonomy; (4) Coral paleobiology, functional morphology and photosymbiosis; (5) Fossil coral reefs: research methods; (6) Reefs in space and time, and (7) Coral paleobiodiversity patterns. Articles must not have been published previously, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere. 

Deadline for manuscript submission is: **15^th^ September 2024**

General submission requirements are provided at [https://e-system.app.pan.pl/app/journal/for_authors/](https://e-system.app.pan.pl/app/journal/for_authors/). Once you have prepared your manuscript according to the instructions, please visit the online submission system [ https://e-system.app.pan.pl/app/login/]( https://e-system.app.pan.pl/app/login/). **In the cover letter please state that the submission is contribution to 14^th^ Symposium of the IFCRS.**

There are no charges for submission of an article. There are no obligatory page charges for papers up to 10 typesetted pages (approximately 30 double-spaced manuscript pages, 12 points Times New Roman font; assuming no illustrations), although any financial support for publication is welcome. For longer papers, a page charge of EUR 22 (VAT included) will be requested for each page over the 10 free typesetted pages. Colour figures are free of charge.

All articles are sent to an Editorial Board member for an initial assessment, and may be returned to authors without in-depth peer review. Following the Editorial Board assessment, manuscripts are sent to at least 2 independent expert consultants for peer review. Articles accepted for publication are instantly published in the forthcoming papers section.
